# üöÄ URNAV Agentic Chat System

## Overview
The URNAV chat system has been transformed into an **intelligent, agentic AI assistant** that can:
- **Detect user intent** from natural language queries
- **Route to appropriate APIs** based on detected intent
- **Use real location data** from the user's device
- **Provide contextual responses** based on location and preferences
- **Learn from user interactions** and build context over time

## üß† How It Works

### 1. Intent Detection
The system analyzes user queries using pattern matching to identify what the user wants:

```typescript
// Example intents detected:
"Where should I go?" ‚Üí explore_places
"I'm hungry" ‚Üí find_food  
"Free activities" ‚Üí free_activities
"Meet my friend" ‚Üí meet_friend
"Plan my day" ‚Üí plan_day
```

### 2. API Routing
Based on detected intent, the system automatically routes to the appropriate Foursquare API endpoint:

- **`explorer`** ‚Üí General place discovery
- **`free-places`** ‚Üí Budget-friendly activities
- **`places/search`** ‚Üí Specific place types (restaurants, parks, etc.)
- **`meet-friend`** ‚Üí Finding meeting spots
- **`plan-day`** ‚Üí Creating day itineraries

### 3. Location Intelligence
The system uses the user's **real GPS coordinates** instead of hardcoded locations:

```typescript
// Gets actual location from device
const { coords } = useGeo()
// Resolves location name via reverse geocoding
const locationName = await getLocationName(coords.lat, coords.lon)
```

### 4. Contextual Memory
User preferences, location, and search history are stored and used for personalized responses:

```typescript
// Stores user context
const { userContext, addSearch, updateLocation } = useChatMemory()
// Uses context for better recommendations
const response = generateResponse(intent, userContext.location, apiData)
```

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Core Files

1. **`/lib/intent-detector.ts`** - Intent detection and response generation
2. **`/lib/api-router.ts`** - API routing and location handling  
3. **`/hooks/use-chat-memory.ts`** - User context and memory management
4. **`/components/chat-interface.tsx`** - Updated chat interface

### Intent Patterns

The system recognizes these query patterns:

```typescript
const INTENT_PATTERNS = [
  // Location-based queries
  {
    patterns: ["where should i go", "places to see", "what to explore"],
    intent: "explore_places",
    action: "search_attractions",
    apiEndpoint: "explorer"
  },
  
  // Food and dining
  {
    patterns: ["restaurant", "food", "hungry", "eat"],
    intent: "find_food", 
    action: "search_restaurants",
    apiEndpoint: "places/search"
  }
  // ... more patterns
]
```

### Entity Extraction

The system extracts additional context from queries:

- **Distance**: "within 5km", "walking distance"
- **Price**: "cheap", "budget-friendly", "luxury"
- **Time**: "today", "now", "tomorrow"
- **Atmosphere**: "quiet", "busy", "peaceful"
- **Dietary**: "vegetarian", "halal", "vegan"

## üì± User Experience

### Natural Language Queries
Users can ask questions in any way:

‚úÖ **"I'm hungry, what's nearby?"**
‚úÖ **"Where should I take my date tonight?"**  
‚úÖ **"Show me free things to do"**
‚úÖ **"I want to meet my friend halfway"**
‚úÖ **"Plan a fun day for me"**

### Intelligent Responses
The system provides contextual, location-aware responses:

```
User: "Where should I go today?"
System: "Based on your location in [City Name], here are some great places to explore:

1. **City Park** - Park (500m away)
   Rating: ‚≠ê 4.5/10

2. **Museum of Art** - Museum (1.2km away)  
   Rating: ‚≠ê 4.3/10

These are just a few options! Would you like me to suggest more specific types of places?"
```

## üß™ Testing

### Test Page
Visit `/test-intent` to test the intent detection system:

- Try different query types
- See detected intents and confidence scores
- Test API routing
- Verify location handling

### Example Test Queries
```typescript
const testQueries = [
  "Where should I go today?",
  "I'm hungry, find me a restaurant", 
  "Show me free places nearby",
  "I want to meet my friend in Mumbai",
  "Plan my day",
  "Find me a park"
]
```

## üîÑ Integration Points

### Backend APIs
The system integrates with existing URNAV backend endpoints:

- `/modes/explorer` - General exploration
- `/modes/free-places` - Free activities
- `/modes/meet-friend` - Meeting spots
- `/modes/plan-day` - Day planning
- `/places/search` - Specific searches

### Frontend Components
- **Chat Interface** - Main interaction point
- **Nearby Places** - Real-time location-based suggestions
- **Map Widget** - Visual location representation
- **Memory System** - Persistent user context

## üöÄ Benefits

### For Users
